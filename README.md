# ChatWindowWithLLMApi

A PYQT5-based LLM chat window optimized for role-playing interactions, with enhanced long-context memory capabilities.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Long-context Optimization**
  By using self-iterative summarization,
  After truncating 40+k of words of dialogue to 4-6k words and sending them to the API, the AI can still retain memories from before the truncation point.
  Significantly saving tokens during extended role-playing scenarios with lengthy plots.

- **Role Play Status Bar:**
  The built-in character status bar will automatically be added to the conversation once enabled and mounted. Status can be updated by the user, AI, or dynamically as the dialogue progresses.
ï»¿
- **Main Story Generator**:
  Rapidly generates worlds and storylines using AI. Supports custom plots. Lightweight AI (free/local-run) is recommended for node updates to minimize API token consumption.

- **Multimodal Generation**  
  Supports synchronous **text generation** and **image generation** during conversations  
  *(Requires [Novita API](https://www.novita.ai/))* 

- **Easy Setup**  
  Automatic dependency installation - just Python required to run  
  *(Recommended to use in virtual environment)*
